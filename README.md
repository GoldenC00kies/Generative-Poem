# Generative-Poem
This is a poem that I created that utilizes random sentences from Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz story. What my program does is print a random sentence from his book, then prints that last word from that sentence, and then it prints another random sentence that starts with the first letter of the previous printed last word. It repeats this process two times to generate a random poem.

## Why did I make this
I decided to make this because I thought it would be interesting to see how the program randomly picks each line based off a certain letter. I wanted to create a surreal feeling poem each time it was randomlly generated and I think I succeeded at that.
